This is the repo for my HTB labs journey

I will also update here my journey at Ecole 2600.

First week: kinda intense for someone who has never coded before or even touched a terminal. Was fine for me.
Second week: definitely more intense, first exercices in C and asm about malloc and memory management. Felt good I successfully debugged my asm code with GDB.
Third week: very intense. We had to make 3 projects on Networks and Linux sys admin. For me who had never done that kind of stuff I needed to read a lot of doc, but learned a lot so that's cool.
