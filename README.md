This is the repo for my HTB labs journey

I will also update here my journey at Ecole 2600.

First week: kinda intense for someone who has never coded before or even touched a terminal. Was fine for me.
Second week: definitely more intense, first exercices in C and asm about malloc and memory management. Felt good I successfully debugged my asm code with GDB.
